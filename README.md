Interactive Arithmetic Calculator with Error Handling
This is a simple Python-based interactive calculator built as part of **Day 1** of the ProSensiaInternship challenge.
The calculator asks for the user's name and two numeric inputs, then performs basic arithmetic operations:
- ➕ Sum  
- ➖ Difference  
- ✖ Product  
- ➗ Division (rounded to 2 decimal places)
It includes basic input validation using `try/except` blocks and a reusable input function.
- Clean, beginner-friendly Python code
- Handles blank or invalid number input
- Graceful handling of division by zero
- Modular input function for reuse
- Uses `f-strings` for clean output formatting
